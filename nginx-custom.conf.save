Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

yaml

version: "3.8"
services:
  angular-app:
    build:
      context: ./angular-app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4200:80"

  spring-boot-app:
    build:
      context: ./spring-boot-app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

Build and run the containers:

    Open a terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and run the following command:

shell

    docker-compose up --build

    This command will build the Docker images for the Angular and Spring Boot applications and run the containers.

    The Spring Boot API will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

That's it! You have successfully deployed an Angular and Spring Boot application on NGINX using Docker Compose.
